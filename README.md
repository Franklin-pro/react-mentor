Your challenge is to build out this art gallery slideshow site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the paintings. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.
Your users should be able to:
Navigate the slideshow and view each painting in a lightbox
View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.



These are the instructions on the above link. use data.json to feed your page with details and focus on the layout and making the page look identical to you design.
